Hello everyone! My name is Chelsea, and I'm the author of the Tome of The Fae series. I am a 25 year old with two daughters ages two and a half and four. I enjoy writing in my free time as well as playing my share of video games and crocheting. I have three French Angora rabbits who's names are Samson, Maribel and Lulu. I live in Upstate South Carolina in the United States in a relatively small farming town. It's usually quiet here with the acception of fireworks and the odd cannon fire from battle ground renactments. It makes the perfect place to sit in the warm southern sun and dream of worlds not yet created and stories untold.
