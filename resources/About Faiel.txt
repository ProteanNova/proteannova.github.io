Faiel is a world that runs parallel with our world, although not all land masses and water ways are in the same places. This world is the world of magic and all things mythical, and was seperated from our world long ago.
In the Fae ruled lands there are 5 kingdoms, the Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter lands as well as the High Queen/Queen of Gateway's kingdom. Although this is as far as the Tome of the Fae series will likely take us, there are many other contents with other ethnic groups such as a kingdom of Dragons, Dwarves, Centaurs and many others. Though the Fae land is the most diverse in creature types in Faiel.
